# javascript ve jquery notlarÄ± 

We will look at what the code on the right does
shortly, but for the moment note that:

* Each of the lines of code in gree n is a statement.
* The pink curly braces indicate the start and end
of a code block. (Each code block could contain
many more statements.)
* The cod e in purple determines which code
should run (as you will see on p149).
